This series of articles is a tutorial of building a C compiler from scratch. 

I lied a little in the above sentence: it is actually an _interpreter_ instead
of _compiler_. I lied because what the hell is a "C interpreter"? You will
however, understand compiler better by building an interpreter.

Yeah, I wish you can get a basic understanding of how a compiler is
constructed, and realize it is not that hard to build one. Good Luck!

Finally, this series is written in Chinese in the first place, feel free to
correct me if you are confused by my English. And I would like it very much if
you could teach me some "native" English :)

We won't write any code in this chapter, feel free to skip if you are
desperate to see some code...

## Why you should care about compiler theory?

Because it is **COOL**!

And it is very useful. Programs are built to do something for us, when they
are used to translate some forms of data into another form, we can call them
compiler. Thus by learning some compiler theory we are trying to master a very
powerful technique of solving problems. Isn't that cool enough to you?

People used to say understanding how compiler works would help you to write
better code. Some would argue that modern compilers are so good at
optimization that you should not care any more. Well, that's true, most people
don't need to learn compiler theory only to improve the efficency of the code.
And by most people, I mean you!

## We Don't Like Theory Either

I have always been in awe of compiler theory because that's what makes
programing easy. Anyway can you imaging building a web browser in only
assembly language? So when I got a chance to learn compiler theory in college,
I was so exciting! And then... I quit, not understanding what that it.

Normally a course of compiler will cover:

1. How to represent syntax (such as BNF, etc.)
2. Lexer, with somewhat NFA(Nondeterministic Finite Automata),
   DFA(Deterministic Finite Automata).
3. Parser, such as recursive descent, LL(k), LALR, etc.
4. Intermediate Languages.
5. Code generation.
6. Code optimization.

Perhaps more than 90% students will not care anything beyond parser, and
what's more, we still don't know how to build a compiler! Even after all these
efforts learning the theories. Well the main reason is that what "Compiler
Thoery" trys to teach is "How to build a parser generator", namely a tool that
consumes syntax gramer and generates a compiler for you. lex/yacc or
flex/bison or things like that.

These theories try to taught us how to solve a general problems of generating
compilers automatically. That means once you've master them, you are able to
deal with all kinds of grammars. They are indeed useful in industry.
Nevertheless they are too powerful and too complicate for students and most
programmers. You will understand that if you try to read lex/yacc's source
code.

Good news is building a compiler can be much simpler than you'd ever imagined.
I won't lie, not easy, but definitely not hard.

## Birth of this project

One day I came across the project [c4](https://github.com/rswier/c4) on
Github. It is a small C interpreter which is claimed to be implemented by only
4 functions. The most amazing part is that it is bootstrapping (that interpret
itself). Also it is done with about 500 lines!

Meanwhile I've read a lot of tutorials about compiler, they are either too
simple(such as implementing a simple calculator) or using automation
tools(such as flex/bison). c4 is however implemented all from scratch. The
sad thing is that it try to be minimal, that makes the code quite a mess, hard
to understand. So I started a new project to:

1. Implement a working C compiler(interpreter actually)
2. Write a tutorial of how it is built.

It took me 1 week to re-write it, resulting 1400 lines including comments. The
project is hosted on Github: [Write a C Interpreter](https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter).

Thanks rswier for bringing us a wonderful project!

## Before you go

Implementing a compiler could be boring and it is hard to debug. So I hope you
can spare enough time studying, as well as type the code. I am sure that you
will feel a great sense of accomplishment just like I do.

## Good Resources

1. [Letâ€™s Build a Compiler](http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/): a very good
   tutorial of building a compiler for fresh starters.
2. [Lemon Parser Generator](http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/): the parser
   generator that is used in SQLite. Good to read if you want to understand
   compiler theory with code.

In the end, I am human with a general level, there will be inevitably wrong
with the articles and codes(also my English). Feel free to correct me!

Hope you enjoy it.
